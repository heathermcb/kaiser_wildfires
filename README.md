# kaiser_wildfires
 some raw data, data cleaning scripts, and analysis for kaiser wildfires project

## Organization

- Things related to, but not necessary for, creation of the final dataset should be stored in the top level folder under an appropriate sub-folder â€” e.g., eda in `eda`, final models in `analysis`.
- Things that we use to create the final dataset should be kept in the `data_processing` folder in the appropriate sub-folder. E.g., all code should be in `code`, all raw data should be in `raw_data`, etc.
- Raw data are any data we received *before* any editing. Raw data should be considered immutable and therefore should never be edited directly. Any derivatives from the raw data should be kept in `data` and the script that goes from raw data to the derivative data should be kept in `code`.
- We omit some raw data, and the final analytic dataset, from the repo because it's private.
- We omit some other raw data from the repo because it's too big to commit.

Omitted files and where to find and put them:

- Kaiser - Kaiser data should be in the raw_data folder. Adding the folder "DMEdatasets20200929172326" to the raw_data folder will make everything run smoothly.

- The analytic dataset has information from the Kaiser dataset in it, so it's not here. It can be created by running "03_an_dat.R" in the code folder. The Kaiser dataset needs to be added to the repo to do this.

- The tigerline shapefile necessary for processing the temperature data is too big for GitHub. It's only necessary to add it if you want to reprocess the temp data. It can be downloaded at https://catalog.data.gov/he/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2019-2010-nation-u-s-2010-census-5-digit-zip-code-tabulation-area-zcta5-na, and should be added to the raw_data folder so that the files are inside a folder called "zcta_shapefile" (raw_data/zcta_shapefile/ the files go here). 


## RIY (like DIY but Run It Yourself)
- It should be possible to run everything in this repo if you open the files in the R Project in the `data_processing` folder, using the 'here' package, without changing pathnames in the files. EXCEPT the temperature processing bash script (01_temp_proc.sh) and the associated R script (which 01_temp_proc.sh runs). Unfortunately, readOGR (necessary to read the raster files in the temperature processing script) and here() are incompatible.
