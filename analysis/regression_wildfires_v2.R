### check the relationship between temperature and hospital visits, so we know what kind of relationship it should have to the outcome
### we already know time is an s() because we plotted that during the EDA

an_dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = wkmntp, y = visitsA)) + geom_line()
an_dat %>% ggplot(aes(x = wkmntp, y = visitsI)) + geom_line()

# definitely looks non-linear/polynomial
# missing data is because we don't have temperature data for 2020 yet, and there are some dates in 2020. 


m1 <- gam(visitsA ~ getty + getty_disaster_20km + s(wkmntp) + s(wkyrseq), data = an_dat, family = nb(link = "log")) 
# nb should estimate theta parameter (dispersion parameter), whereas negbin would not and would require a specification
