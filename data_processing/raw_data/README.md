 some raw data, data cleaning scripts, and analysis for kaiser wildfires project

## RAW DATA FOLDER
- Private Kaiser data can be added to this folder, by adding the folder "DMEdatasets20200929172326" to this one. 
- Folders PRISM 2016-2019 contain raw PRISM temperature data in .bil format from https://prism.oregonstate.edu/recent/. They are daily mean temperature files. 
- This zcta tigerline shapefile should be added to the repo, with the files in a folder called "zcta_shapefile". It's too big for GitHub and can be found here: https://catalog.data.gov/he/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2019-2010-nation-u-s-2010-census-5-digit-zip-code-tabulation-area-zcta5-na
