# kaiser_wildfires
 some raw data, data cleaning scripts, and analysis for kaiser wildfires project

## EDA FOLDER

- This folder contains files for exploratory data analysis of the Kaiser dataset. 
- Any information/metadata we know about the files is written in as part of the EDA. 
- There are five files because we have five files from Kaiser describing different kinds of hospital visits. Each file repeats the same EDA but for a different outcomes (aka it repeats the EDA but for a different kind of hospital visits).
